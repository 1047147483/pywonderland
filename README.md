# A Tour in the Wonderland of Math with Python

<p align="center"><img src="http://www.pywonderland.com/polytopes/logo.png"/></p>

> A collection of python scripts for drawing beautiful figures or animating interesting algorithms in mathematics.

## About this repo

Math is beautiful, but to truly enjoy it one has to walk a long and painful way before he could stand on the hill and see the full landscape. I hope this repo could help those people without a strong math background get some intuitive understanding of the beauty of math. The topics are chosen largely due to my personal taste:

1. They should produce appealing results.
2. There should be some non-trivial math behind them.
3. The code should be as simple as possible.

I'll use only popular python libs and build all math stuff from the gound. (`sage`, `sympy` and `mathemetica` are not used here)

You can visit the [website for this repository](http://www.pywonderland.com) to see how to use these scripts and get more information of the math behind them.

I'm still building the docs so that there will be more usage & math explanations for each program.

The history commits are deleted (sorry for this) but will not be deleted any more.

**This repository will be always under construction since there are too many interesting things in math that can be shown by code.** Pull requests, issues, questions, and suggestions are all welcomed!

**Warning:** I'll not maintain support for `python<=2.7` any more, please run the code with `python>=3`.
