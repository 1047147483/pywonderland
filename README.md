## About this repo

Please visit [the website for this repository](http://www.pywonderland.com) to see how to use these scripts and get more information of the math behind them.

I'm building the docs so that there will be more usage & math explanations for each program.

The history commits are deleted (sorry for this) but will not be deleted any more.

**This repository will be always under construction since there are too many interesting things in math that can be shown by code.** Pull requests, issues, questions, and suggestions are all welcomed!
