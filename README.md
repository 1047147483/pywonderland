# A Tour in the Wonderland of Math with Python

<p align="center"><img src="./alice.png"></p>

> A collection of python scripts for drawing beautiful figures or animating interesting algorithms in mathematics.

I'm building the docs so that there will be more usage & math explanations for each program.

The history commits are deleted (sorry for this) but will not be deleted any more.

**This repository will be always under construction since there are too many interesting things in math that can be shown by code.** Pull requests, issues, questions, and suggestions are all welcomed!
