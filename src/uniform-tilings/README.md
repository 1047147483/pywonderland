# Uniform tilings and automata of Coxeter groups

This is a very first version of a very complicated program: draw uniform Euclidean/Spherical/Hyperbolic tilings using automata of Coxeter groups. The purpose of this project is:

1. Render 2d tilings in svg format.
2. Render 3d tilings in POV-Ray.

**Implemented features**:

1. 2d uniform Euclidean tilings.
2. 2d/3d uniform hyperbolic tilings in Poincare's disk/ball.


TODO:

1. snub and Catalan tilings.
2. lots of more fancy features.
3. a detailed doc explains the math.
4. Escher tiling using a user input svg image.
5. Honeycombs with ideal and hyperideal vertices.
