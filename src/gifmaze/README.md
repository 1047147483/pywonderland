This project generates gif animations of various maze algorithms, simply run the `example*.py` scripts (without arguments) to see the results :smile:.

**Requirements**: `pillow` and `tqdm`.

There is also a Javascript animation of Wilson's uniform spanning tree algorithm in the directory `/js/`, it's translated directly from the python version implemented in `algorithms.py`.

**Update**: add animations for game of life, Langton's ant and Hilbert curve.
