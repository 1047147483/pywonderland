This project generates gif animations of various maze algorithms, run the `example*.py` scripts to see the results :smile:.

For example run

```bash
python example_embed_backgroud_image.py
```

and wait for a few seconds you will see a gif image is generated:

<img style="margin:0px auto;display:block" src="https://neozhaoliang.github.io/gifmaze/wilson-bfs.gif"/>

Requirements: `pillow` and `tqdm`.

These is also a Javascript animation of Wilson's uniform spanning tree algorithm in the directory `/js/`, it's translated directly from the Python version in `algorithms.py`.
