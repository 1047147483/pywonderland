This is a very simple shader program for making animations of various 3d fractals. Simply run `python fractal3d.py` and choose a `.frag` file in the dialog to render the scene, each `.frag` file in the `/glsl/` contains an independent scene. I'll add more fractals in the future (but occasionally).

Keyboard control:

+ press `Enter` to save screenshots.
+ press `Ctrl + s` to choose another scene.
+ press `Esc` to escape.

More command line options:

```
python fractal3d.py -size 800x600 -aa 2
```
