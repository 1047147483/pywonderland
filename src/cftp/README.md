# Coupling from the past and lozenge tilings

This is our final project on "perfectly random sampling", the previous two projects on this topic are [domimo shuffling algorithm animation](https://github.com/neozhaoliang/pywonderland#domino-shuffling-algorithm-animation) and [Wilson's uniform spanning tree algorithm animation](https://github.com/neozhaoliang/pywonderland#wilsons-uniform-spanning-tree-algorithm-animation).

**Requirements**: `tqdm` and `cairocffi`.

## Usage

Just run `main.py`. By default this will sample a random lozenge tiling of a 20x20x20 hexagon from the uniform distribution.
