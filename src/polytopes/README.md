# Usage

+ `run_3d_polyhedra_animation.py` calls `POV-Ray` to render the frames of a rotating polyhedra in 3d space.
+ `run_4d_rotation_animation.py` calls `POV-Ray` to render the frames of a rotating polyhedra/polychora in 4d space.
+ `run_dimensions_movie.py` calls `POV-Ray` to render the frames of an animation which reproduces the scene of 120-cell in the movie "Dimensions: A walk through mathematics".
+ `run_coset_enumeration.py` reads the data of a finitely presented group from a `yaml` file and outputs its coset table.
+ `run_polychora_example.py` calls `POV-Ray` to render "curved" polychora.
+ `run_wythoff_shader_animation.py` is a shader program for real-time animation, it's exported from Matt Zucker's [shadertoy program](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Md3yRB).
